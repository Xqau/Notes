## How Will India be Affected
-   An invasion by Russia would put pressure on India to choose between the Western alliance and Russia.
    -   Maintaining strong relations with Russia serves India’s national interests. India has to retain a strong strategic alliance with Russia as a result, India cannot join any Western strategy aimed at isolating Russia.
-   There is a possibility of [CAATSA](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/countering-americas-adversaries-through-sanctions-act-caatsa/) (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions on India by the U.S. as a result of the **S-400**
-   A pact between the US and Russia might affect Russia’s relations with China. This might allow India to expand on its efforts to re-establish ties with Russia.
-   The issue with Ukraine is that the world is becoming increasingly economically and geopolitically interconnected. Any improvement in Russia-China ties has ramifications for India.
-   There is also an impact on the strong Indian diaspora present in the region, threatening the lives of thousands of Indian students.

## Indian Stance
- Neutrality is the Word here
-  Immediately after the annexation, India abstained from voting in the [UN General Assembly](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/united-nations-general-assembly-unga/) on a resolution that sought to condemn Russia.
-   In 2020, India voted against a Ukraine-sponsored resolution in the UN General Assembly that sought to condemn alleged human rights violations in Crimea.
-   India’s position is largely rooted in neutrality and has adapted itself to the post-2014 status quo on Ukraine.
