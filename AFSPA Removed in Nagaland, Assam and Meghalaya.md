# AFSPA
### Why in News?

Recently, the Union Government has partially withdrawn the **Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), 1958** from parts of **three Northeast states— Assam, Nagaland and Manipur.**

-   Currently, AFSPA remains in force in parts of these **three states as well as in parts of Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir.**
-   **Background:**
    -   The British colonial government had on 15th August, 1942, **promulgated the Armed Forces Special Powers Ordinance to suppress the [Quit India movement.](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/quit-india-movement-1)**
    -   It was the foundation for four ordinances, including **one for the “Assam disturbed areas” invoked in 1947** to deal with Partition-induced internal security challenges.
    -   The **Armed Forces (Assam and Manipur) Special Powers Act, 1958, followed the Assam Disturbed Areas Act of 1955** to deal with the uprising in the Naga Hills and adjoining areas.
    -   The Act was **replaced by the AFSPA for wider application.** A **similar Act specific to Jammu and Kashmir** was enacted in 1990.

- ###  **About:**
    -   AFSPA gives **sweeping powers to the armed forces.**
        -   For example, it allows them to **open fire, even causing death, against any person in contravention to the law or carrying arms and ammunition.**
        -   Also, it gives them powers to **arrest individuals without warrants,** on the basis of **“reasonable suspicion”**, and **search premises without warrants.**
    -   It can be imposed by the Centre or the Governor of a state, on the state or parts of it, after these areas are declared **“disturbed’’ under Section 3.**
        -   The Act was amended in 1972 and the powers to **declare an area as “disturbed”** were conferred concurrently **upon the Central government along with the States.**
        -   Currently, the Union Home Ministry issues periodic **“disturbed area” notification to extend AFSPA only for Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.**
        -   The notification for Manipur and Assam is issued by the State governments.
        -   **Tripura revoked the Act in 2015 and Meghalaya was under AFSPA for 27 years, until it was revoked by the MHA from 1st April 2018.**

### States Under or Have Been Under AFSPA

- Assam 
- Punjab

### Supreme Court Verdict, 1998:

In the case of _Naga People’s Movement of Human Rights vs. Union of India,_ the validity of AFSPA was challenged before the Supreme Court and the five-judge bench concluded that the act cannot be considered as a violation of the Constitution

### The Jeevan Reddy Committee:

On November 19, 2004, the Central government appointed a five-member committee headed by **Justice BP Jeevan Reddy** to review the provisions of the act in the northeastern states.

The Committee had recommended a complete repeal of the law. “The Act is a symbol of hate, oppression, and an instrument of high-handedness,” it said.
