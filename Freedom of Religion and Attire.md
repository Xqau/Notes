# Freedom of Religion and Attire

### Why in News
- Students banned from entering the premises of a junior college because of wearing a hijab
- This put up a question against the SC relating to freedom of religion and attire in the educational institutions and the power of such institutions to rule in favour of having a strict dress code and its intervention with the freedoms of religion

## Freedom of Religion in Constitution
- [[Fundamental Rights in Indian Constitution|Art 25(1)]]
- It also provides the state power to interfere in the matters relating to religion in order to maintain peace and liberty of the citizens
- The SC chooses which religious practices are constitutionally okay and which are not
- In the SC the **Shirur Matt Case** has stated that when the court mentions religion it is usually talking about the integral practices of the religion.

## End Verdict
- The HC supported the stance of the state and said that while there is a fundamental guarantee provided to the citizens there is also provision for reasonable restrictions. 
- Wearing hijab or any such specific cloth is not okay as it is clearly against the guidelines of the educational institution. While there is right to freedom of religion there is also need to put reasonable restrictions to maintain public order
